# TetrisAI-MB

TetrisAI using search/heuristics. At every step, the algorithm checks every possible way to drop the current piece and chooses best one using four different features described [here](https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/).


### Running the code

No externals needed. Just run the gui.py file and watch the algorithm play.
